# WSB2024Exam
Documentation code for DS821 Exam

All python code has been written in jupyternotebooks. I've used the following structure:
1. Data
2. Stock_Data
3. Sentiment Model
4. Entity recognition model
5. Correlation analysis,

Make sure to read the ipynb files in above order, as this is the way they are intended to. Additionally i've added a folder called data. In there you can find original kaggle csv file ('reddit_wsb.csv'), as well as CSV files as they get filtered in various steps of the process.
