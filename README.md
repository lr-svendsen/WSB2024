# WSB2024Exam
Documentation code for DS821 Exam

All python code has been written in jupyternotebooks. I've used the following structure:
1. [**Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/1.%20Data.ipynb)
2. [**Stock_Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/2.%20Stock_Data.ipynb)
3. [**Sentiment Model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/3.%20Sentiment%20Model.ipynb)
4. [**Entity recognition model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/4.%20Entity%20Recognition.ipynb)
5. [**Correlation analysis**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/5.%20Correlation%20analysis.ipynb)

Make sure to read the ipynb files in above order, as this is the way they are intended to. Additionally i've added a folder called data. In there you can find original kaggle csv file ('reddit_wsb.csv'), as well as CSV files as they get filtered in various steps of the process.
