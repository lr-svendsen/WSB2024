# WSB2024Exam
Documentation code for DS821 Exam

All python code has been written in jupyternotebooks. I've used the following structure:
1. [**Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/1.%20Data.ipynb)
2. [**Stock_Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/2.%20Stock_Data.ipynb)
3. [**Sentiment Model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/3.%20Sentiment%20Model.ipynb)
4. [**Entity recognition model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/4.%20Entity%20Recognition.ipynb)
5. [**Correlation analysis**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/5.%20Correlation%20analysis.ipynb)

Make sure to read the ipynb files in above order, as this is the way they are intended to. Additionally, i've added the initial data used "reddit_wsb.csv", which is from the kaggle file. If you start sequentially with the notebooks, the code will automatically generate cleaned up and filtered datasets. So if you want to run file 5, and dont have the dataset. Look through for example file 1, which likely generates it.
