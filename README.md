# WSB2024Exam
Documentation code for DS821 Exam

All python code has been written in jupyternotebooks. I've used the following structure:
1. [**Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/1.%20Data.ipynb)
2. [**Stock_Data**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/2.%20Stock_Data.ipynb)
3. [**Sentiment Model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/3.%20Sentiment%20Model.ipynb)
4. [**Entity recognition model**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/4.%20Entity%20Recognition.ipynb)
5. [**Correlation analysis**](https://github.com/lr-svendsen/WSB2024Exam/blob/0ff63a433179dccb293fac4372630cf0f027e609/5.%20Correlation%20analysis.ipynb)

Make sure to read the ipynb files in above order, as this is the way they are intended to. The data could not be uploaded (25mb limit on GitHub). Therefore, if you wish to run the files; simply get the data yourself from the kaggle site first. Then run it through the 5 notebooks above, since it wil automatically generate cleaned up and filtered datasets.
